            <p>Meow Meow Cat is a game I developed for a digital prototyping subject.</p>
            <p>It is a single-player, side-scrolling game that requires players to move in a continuous direction, from left to right, through a series of coloured dots. The player takes on the role of the cat whose aim is to reach a ray of sunshine to take a nap by moving along coloured dots on the screen. Players move Meow Meow along by stepping on the corresponding coloured dot on the floor mat to reach the sunshine.</p>

                <h2>Prototypes</h2>
                <p>Four prototypes were constructed for this project, a video and three interactive prototypes.  The interactive prototypes use ActionScript 3 for the game interface and a Makey Makey device to connect the interface to physcial controllers. They are a high-fidelity, fixed-path prototype that users can interact with.</p>
                <p>Each prototype tested a specific element of the game, simulating or omitting parts that weren't related to what was being tested.</p>

            <div class="w3-half portfoliotext digproto-columns">

                <h3>Interactive Prototype 1 (IP1)</h3>
                <p>In this prototype, users press keyboard arrows (assigned a colour) that correspond with the dot colour to move the character forward. The prototype consists of one level and users are timed. The purpose of this prototype is to test the gameplay of movement through the interaction between the character and the row of dots.
                In this prototype, character movement is simulated by the row of dots moving underneath the character. Users will also be timed to see how long it takes them to complete a level.</p>

                <h3>Interactive Prototype 2 (IP2)</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this prototype was to test which formation of floor dots is both challenging and engaging enough. Users were asked to try two different formations (square and row formations) with both the time taken and number of games recorded. The two different formations were both a basic level (25 dots). The dots are
                connected to the computer through a Makey Makey device which direct the user inputs.</p><p>Feedback from previous sessions which were changed in this prototype:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Patterns were added to colours to increase colour accessibility.</li>
                <li>The start, stop and reset button was changed to a ‘New game’ and ‘end’ button. Users had not previously used the stop button and found it confusing. The buttons are now simplified to the two actions users take.</li>
                <li>‘Controllers’ (i.e. dots) in both formations are set far enough away from each other to prevent users from “mashing” the buttons simultaneously.</li>

                <h3>Interactive Prototype 3 (IP3)</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this prototype is to test two things: 'Does the background colour changing simulate the change in time, specifically from daytime to nighttime?' and 'Do users like being able to see their high score on the screen?'.  In this prototype, users use a stick to tap coloured balls of playdough that corresponds with the dot colour to move the character forward. The balls are connected to the computer through a Makey Makey device which
                direct the user inputs. The background colour changes at 5 second increments to show the passage of time simulating sunset. Users have 25 seconds to complete a game of 25.</p>

                <p>Feedback from previous sessions which were changed in this prototype:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The floor dots from the previous prototype were a good simulation of the final concept inputs but their build was unreliable. For this prototype, playdough was chosen as a fun, physically interactive medium interim to allow me to test other elements but without relying on keyboard inputs.</li>
                <li>A chevron was added to further help users identify which colour they have to tap next.</li>
                <li>A timer was added as an element of pressure to the game and make it more engaging.</li>
                <li>The background colour will change from yellow (sunlight) to dark blue (nighttime) to indicate the sun moving further away and signal the timer reaching the end of the level. Colours change every 5 seconds with the timer and aim to mimic sunset. Future prototypes might include the sun setting as time progresses.</li>
                <li>High scores were added to the stage as in previous sessions users were already taking note of this and trying to better their time on subsequent goes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Testing process</h3>
                <p>Testing the game involved a series of sessions with users.  Each session had the same process, script, and survey to evaluate the game.</p>
