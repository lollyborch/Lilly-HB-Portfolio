                    <p>Working collaboratively within a small team, I helped design and prototype a physical, interactive and experiential concept for the new terminal at the Brisbane Airport. We were tasked with devising an interactive product or system that delivers an innovative, public and social user experience. </p>
            
            <p>After extensive research, concept ideation, and user feedback, our team narrowed down the problem space to baggage collection, as this ranks as a top “bug” for many passengers. We addressed this problem with Smart Track, a luggage status tracking and notification app.  </p>
            
            <p>This project covered user research, problem definition, concept ideation and testing.  While we developed the interface design and tested user interaction, the app functionality was not developed during this project. </p>

                     <h2>The Smart Track app</h2>
            <p>Our final solution, the Smart Track app, allows users to login with thier booking details or by scanning their boarding pass. All passengers on the booking are displayed along with how many peices of luggage they have checked. Users can also toggle notifications on/off to alert them when their bag reaches checkpoints throughout the process. To help coordinate passenger pick-up, friends and family can also use the app to receive alerts on when passengers have collected their bags and are ready to be collected.</p>

                    <br /><h2>Design thinking methods</h2>
                 
                 <p>For this project, we employed many design thinking tools to help us develop a well researched and tested concept that met both the client and user needs.  I engaged in the methods listed below. </p>
                 
                 <h3>User research</h3>
                 <p>Conducted direct user observations, tracking, interviews and questionnaires, to gain an understanding of our target audience and their needs and preferences.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Personas</h3>
                 <p>Created and used personas to help target our ideas towards the user.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Scenarios and storyboards</h3>
                 <p>Developed specific user scenarios and storyboards to map how our users could/would intereact with our concept.</p>
    
                 <h3>Concept mapping</h3>
                 <p>Mapped new and exisiting concepts against key criteria from the brief to compare ideas and highlight strengths and weaknesses of concepts.</p>
                 
                 
                   <div class="w3-half digproto-columns">
                 
                     <h3>Body storming</h3>
                     <p>Conducted and participated in body storming sessions to understand key user interactions with our concept. This helped to further refine our ideas and work through possible problems.</p>

                     <h3>Design Sprints</h3>
                     <p>Ran design sprints with team and peers to generate solutions to the brief.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="w3-half digproto-columns">

                </div>

                     <h3>Prototypes</h3>
                     <p>Produced lo and hi fidelity prototypes to test interaction and workflow with users.  Prototypes included paper prototypes of app screens that were used in a body storming session and mobile app screens that users could click through.</p>

                     <h3>User workshops</h3>
                     <p>Facilitated user workshops and interviews to garner feedback to iterate into design.</p>

                     <h3>Success criteria</h3>
                     <p>Developed and evaluated success criteria to assess project outcomes.</p>
